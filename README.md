**Curious Router RN** is a versatile file-based routing library for React Native inspired by the simplicity and power of Next.js routing and built on top of React Navigation.<br />With just a few lines of setup, you can seamlessly integrate a robust routing system into your new or existing React Native project, making navigation a breeze.

## Features

- üõ£Ô∏è **File-based Routing**: Define routes using file and folder structures.
- üîå **Plug and Play**: Extremely simple setup for quick integration.
- üöÄ **High Performance**: Optimized for React Native, ensuring smooth navigation transitions.
- ‚öõÔ∏è **React Native Compatible**: Designed specifically for React Native projects.
- üé® **Customizable**: Tailor your routing system to fit your project's needs.

## Installation

You can install Curious Router RN using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install curious-router-rn
# or
yarn add curious-router-rn
```

## Initialize the Router

In your main application file (e.g., `App.jsx`), import and initialize Curious Router RN:

```jsx
import { CuriousRouter } from 'curious-router-rn';

const App = () => {
  return <CuriousRouter initialRoute={'home'} />;
};

export default App;
```

After that open the `metro.config.js` file and add the following lines of code in it:

```js
const config = {
  // Add these three lines
  transformer: {
    babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('curious-router-rn/dist/cjs/api'),
    cacheKey: `curious-router-rn:${new Date().getTime()}`,
  },
};
```

## Setup Routes

Create a `screens` folder in your project directory and add your route components as separate files. For example:

```bash
/screens
  /home
    page.jsx
  /profile
    page.jsx
  /settings
    page.jsx
```

That's it! You now have a file-based routing system in your React Native project.
